## Time taken
My versions and work log are detailed in the comments at the top of hw3.c.  
I have taken 7.5 hours in total to create my candy canes.  
In the future, I may make snowflakes. 
My idea for a final project is to make a metallic park bench under a lamp with some piles of snow around, snowflakes falling, and candy canes planted in the snow, like a sort of winter fantasy.
